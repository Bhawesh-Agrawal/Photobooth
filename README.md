Heyy Everyone!

This is kindoff my first sucessfull project with some unsuccess.

I tried using flask as my backend but I wasn't able to deploy it render used to show error everytime. 

Ya so basically, I tried cloning Backiee with some twist of my own. I learned a lot during this project I used javascript for the first time. If you want to access my project you can check the login page and Index page. 
The backend won't work as for that we will need a database which you will need to setup yourself as well as you will need to setup flask server in your localmachine. In future I will try shifting my project to Node.js
but hope noone minds in my first attmepy.
